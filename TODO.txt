TODO UI webpack

TODO Download Open Sans fonts and bundle them

TODO Statistics: TOP "Not Found" Resources
TODO Statistics: TOP "Server Error" Resources
TODO Statistics: TOP "Error" Resources (???)

TODO Reconsider Payload page charts: too different values on the same chart; total send in minute could be way bigger then max/avg

TODO Bubble Chart: X: response size, Y: number of requests, Z: Average processing time (number of errors ???)

TODO Use "debug" module for tracing; remove log4j

TODO Match req.route.path with swagger spec, to find corresponding swagger path entry and definition

TODO Tab "Deprecated API usage" - show statistics on API methods declared as deprecated

TODO Note: if APi is not declared in swagger spec, it's OK - just capture it from route.path and store without extra parameters

TODO Tab "API request Details". Include drop-down with the list of all known API entries, show first by default if parameter is not passed

TODO !!! Consider counting only when response is finished. Otherwise different ways of counting for API and non-API stats: don't know path at the time of request

TODO Support API Matching for definitions like this: /Accounts/{AccountSid}/Recordings{mediaTypeExtension}

TODO Consider ReRes Stat for entire last hour ( sliding window ). Update it when time bucket added/removed ( add / substract from bucket's stats )
