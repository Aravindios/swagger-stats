TODO Consider counting only when response is finished - only if request was not matched to API.

TODO Statistics: TOP "Not Found" Resources
TODO Statistics: TOP "Server Error" Resources
TODO Statistics: TOP "Error" Resources (???)

TODO Statistics: Clients stats field / page - analyze clients by remote address

TODO Tab "Deprecated API usage" - show statistics on API methods declared as deprecated

TODO Check API Matching for definitions like this: /Accounts/{AccountSid}/Recordings{mediaTypeExtension}

TODO Consider ReqRes Stat for entire last hour ( sliding window ). Update it when time bucket added/removed ( add / substract from bucket's stats )

TODO Reconsider Payload page charts: too different values on the same chart; total send in minute could be way bigger then max/avg

TODO Count Distribution of requestts / responces across scale by content size
TODO i.e. 0: 10, 1kb: 1, 2k: 2 .... 10k: 8, 20k:8
TODO Show distribution chart

TODO Biggest request / response table

TODO Bubble Chart: X: response size, Y: number of requests, Z: Average processing time (number of errors ???)
