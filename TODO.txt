TODO Download Open Sans fonts and bundle them

TODO Consider slimscroll ?
TODO Consider animate.css ?

TODO Statistics: Rates !!!!

TODO Statistics: TOP "Not Found" Resources
TODO Statistics: TOP "Server Error" Resources
TODO Statistics: TOP "Error" Resources (???)

TODO Bubble Chart: X: response size, Y: number of requests, Z: Average processing time (number of errors ???)

TODO Tab "Payload": Widgets: bytes per request/ errors, etc. Line chart: bytes in/bytes out over last 60 min

TODO Use "debug" module for tracing; remove log4j

TODO Match req.route.path with swagger spec, to find corresponding swagger path entry and definition

TODO From Swagger spec, include key properties of Operation object to the stats object, API entry
TODO I.e. tags ( show in table column, so can be filtered by tag ), summary and description (expan row and show those )
TODO Link to external doc (also in expand) OperationID (column ?)
TODO Deprecated - Column !

TODO Tab "Deprecated API usage" - show statistics on API methods declared as deprecated

TODO Note: if APi is not declared in swagger spec, it's OK - just capture it from route.path and store without extra parameters

TODO Tab "API request Details". Include drop-down with the list of all known API entries, show first by default if parameter is not passed

TODO !!! Consider counting only when response is finished. Otherwise different ways of counting for API and non-API stats: don't know path at the time of request
