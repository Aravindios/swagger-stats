/**
 * Prometheus Histogram metric
 *
 * https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/
 *
 * A histogram samples observations (usually things like request durations or response sizes) and counts them in configurable buckets.
 * It also provides a sum of all observed values.
 *
 * A histogram with a base metric name of <basename> exposes multiple time series during a scrape:
 *  cumulative counters for the observation buckets, exposed as <basename>_bucket{le="<upper inclusive bound>"}
 *  the total sum of all observed values, exposed as <basename>_sum
 *  the count of events that have been observed, exposed as <basename>_count (identical to <basename>_bucket{le="+Inf"} above)
 *
 *
 * https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-query-prometheus-on-ubuntu-14-04-part-2#step-3-â€”-working-with-histograms
 *
 * Internally, histograms are implemented as a group of time series that each represent the count for a given bucket
 * (e.g. "requests under 10ms", "requests under 25ms", "requests under 50ms", and so on).
 * The bucket counters are cumulative, meaning that buckets for larger values include the counts for all lower-valued buckets.
 * On each time series that is part of a histogram, the corresponding bucket is indicated by
 * the special le (less-than-or-equal) label. This adds an additional dimension to any existing dimensions you are already tracking.
